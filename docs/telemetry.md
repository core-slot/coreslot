# Telemetry files

With `[telemetry] enabled = true` coreslot keeps a local record of what the machine and each run
did in `$S/telemetry/`. Nothing leaves the machine. `sample_log = true` alone writes
`samples.jsonl` and nothing else.

Each file is JSON lines. The tick that writes samples rotates `samples.jsonl` and `events.jsonl`,
each to one older generation (`samples.1.jsonl`, `events.1.jsonl`), at 256 MiB. A write that fails
costs its line. A reader skips a line it cannot parse.

## `samples.jsonl`

One line per machine sample, written by whichever run takes the sample.

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `v` | the schema of the line, 1 |
| `time_ns` | when the sample was taken, ns since the epoch |
| `t_ns` | the host reading's clock, ns since boot, counting sleep; the detector's times are on it |
| `awake_ns` | the same clock without sleep |
| `level` | the detector's level: `green`, `unknown`, `yellow`, `red`, `floor` |
| `excess` | the stall excess E, in points |
| `bucket` | the red bucket |
| `gate` | whether the paging gate was open |
| `decomp_s` | decompressions per second |
| `swapins_s` | swap-ins per second |
| `psi_some_us_s` | PSI `some` in microseconds per second; null where the platform has no PSI |
| `swap_used_mib` | swap in use |
| `swap_free_mib` | swap free |
| `vm_free_mib` | free space on the volume that holds the swap, on macOS; 0 elsewhere |
| `room_mib` | the admission room; 0 when `headroom_ok` is false |
| `live_holds` | every live hold, running or not; `jobs` lists only those that ticked recently |
| `headroom_mib` | the headroom admission read |
| `headroom_ok` | whether `headroom_mib` is a reading; when false, its 0 is not one |
| `reserve_mib` | the reserve admission used |
| `jobs` | the running, freshly ticked holds: `hold`, `label`, `arrival_ns`, `need_mib`, `footprint_mib`, the time deltas `d_user_ns`, `d_sys_ns`, `d_page_wait_ns`, `share` (null when the job reported no time), `normal_share`, `learned`, `victim`, `cpu_ns`, `typical_cpu_s`, `typical_s`, `stall_ewma` |
| `stop` | present on the sample that wrote a stop round: the holds it lists |

A sample whose reading failed reports `level` `unknown`, zero readings and `headroom_ok` false.
